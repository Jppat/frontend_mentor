## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Applied semantic html elements such as main and section.
- Learned that setting height: 100vh can cut elements on the page. Using min-height avoids that.
- Added custom fonts using ```css @font-face``` as I learned from another user.
- Used custom css variables.
- Got to work with HTML tables
- It's incredibly helpul to keep in mind the basic relationship of each tag/element, 
i.e., parent-child relationships. This makes it easier to debug designs.

### Continued development

- To be more comfortable with using em or rem for sizes.
