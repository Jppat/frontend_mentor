## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Applied semantic html elements such as main and section.
- Learned that setting height: 100vh can cut elements on the page. Using min-height avoids that.
- Added custom fonts using ```css @font-face``` as I learned from another user.
- Used custom css variables.
- Got to work with HTML tables

### Continued development

- Need to be understand more about how parents and their child elements interact, especially in terms of sizing.
