## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

* reinforced my understanding of the concept of the CSS Box model
* using Google fonts via the link tag
* reinforced my understanding of how child elements use their parent elements' margin and padding as basis

### Continued development

* CSS styling is over the place. I don't have a system in implementing varying font-weights and font-styles. Styling is very literal and I need to learn how to style more effeciently.
