## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am coming from an Odin Project background. I have been taking the Web Development Foundations course, and in this challenge I mostly applied
all that I have learned from the mentioned course/curriculum.

1. HTML structure - When it comes to structuring HTML, I haven't yet established a mental framework to follow, however, currently I just like to group 
related things together under one div.

2. CSS - When I was early in learning the Odin Project curriculum, I learned that when no width is set, containers take the space of its contents. However,
I never really got a firm hold on that knowledge. That's why I had a bit of trouble trying to center the card on the screen. 

  Setting the margins to auto only centered the card horizontally. So, I added borders to see more clearly what was going on, and that's when I realized that the container was only taking the vertical space taken by the card. After that, I set the width of the body to 99vh to take up the whole viewport space. For some reason, setting it to 100vh took space a little beyond what I can see on the screen. I haven't yet done my research why this happens.

3. Flexbox - this challenge also gave me an opportunity to play around with some basic concepts related to flexbox, such as setting the flex-direction, as well as using the flex shorthand.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I did the challenge without much thought abour responsiveness, the only concept I used related to this is setting the card's max-width.
